<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Sheikh 🖖</h1>
<h3 align="center">🦄 Coding in heaven, for a sweeter world</h3>

> I'm a developer from [Chennai](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Chennai/) in India and work as a freelance Android Developer.
> I still solve many problems with Java, but as a Kotlin fanboy to spread this K-Virus and the idea of clean & colorful software engineering.
> I build mobile apps in Kotlin language with Jetpack Compose, with clean architecture and the SOLID principle to ensure the colorful software engineering.
> I'm happy to be a part of a great developer community where sharing is caring.

> Apart from coding, I like reading history books, exploring techstack, having chats in the evenings with friends and playing computer games.
> As corona limited a few outdoor hobbies, I also bought myself a 3D printer which I feed with plastic and construction plans.
